## The Accidental Metadata Maestro: A Journey Through Streaming, Search, and Surviving Product Meetings

It all started with a simple realization: people love watching TV, but they hate searching for what to watch. That’s where I come in. I’ve spent years making sure people don’t have to scroll endlessly through streaming platforms, questioning their life choices.

My career began in the depths of customer support, where I quickly learned two things: (1) people are really passionate about their TV guides, and (2) the ability to stay calm while explaining “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” is an underrated skill. From there, I took a deep dive into metadata—yes, that magical behind-the-scenes ingredient that makes search engines and recommendations work (or not work, depending on how much coffee they’ve had).

As I climbed the ladder, I found myself leading metadata teams, streamlining operations, and making sure that when someone searched for “that one movie with the guy from that thing,” they actually found it. Then came my adventures in platform management and analytics, where I helped make sense of the endless ocean of user behavior data—turns out, people really do start binge-watching at 2 AM on Tuesdays.

At some point, I decided that just fixing search wasn’t enough—I wanted to own it. So, I spearheaded the development of an in-house search engine, a white-label product designed to stop the endless scrolling struggle. And because what’s search without recommendations, I also led the charge on building an in-house recommendation engine—think of it as a matchmaking service for people and their perfect TV show (without the awkward first date).

Now, my days are filled with strategizing, optimizing, and making sure our AI doesn’t accidentally suggest horror movies to rom-com lovers. I thrive at the intersection of technology, user experience, and business strategy—translating complex algorithms into real-world solutions that make streaming seamless.

I’ve spent my career making content discovery better, one metadata tag at a time. If you want to talk about search, recommendations, or why people still love reality TV, let’s connect.
